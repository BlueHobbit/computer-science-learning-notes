# Summary

# Notes
- I've learnt about DHCP and ARP before while I was on the college course and doing the networking module. This room covers it in a lot more technical detail than they did at college though especially by demonstrating the actual process which uses the MAC and IP broadcast addresses.
  - It makes a lot more sense to me now, and explains something which confused me before which is how can the device being configured know the IP address of the DHCP server when it hasn't been on the network before?
  - The answer simply being that using the broadcasting address means it simply doesn't have to, only send the request everywhere then get the response from the server at which point communication has essentially been established though the broadcast address is still used.

- The MAC Address is made up of 6 octets to be clear which is why it's 48 bits long. 

- What is ICMP type 8?
  - Are there other types and if so what are they?
    - Yes there are, I've seen type 0 and 8 so far. They seem to be types of ICMP packet that can be sent between devices. 

- I've used ping and traceroute before but I liked the extra of showing the wireshark captures to show the actual technical details. 
  - I don't think traceroute seems to work inside of the TryHackMe room itself as the packets always seem to be getting dropped without a Timeout exceeded message ever being sent back. 

- I'd love an actual example of using ping or traceroute diagnostically to be in this room or one of the other ones as it would certainly help me get better at troubleshooting.
  - Critically an example beyond just checking that a device is actually connected to the network by pinging it.

- The different routing algorithms seem to all take up a certain degree of space regardless of which they are but I can see why BGP is the main internet protocol as the premise essentially would establish communication highways between networks without having to store routing information for every possible connection though this might not always be optimally efficient.
  - OSPF seems particularly heavy on storage as each router would be holding information about the others and building itself as complete a map as possible with each router essentially having masses of duplicate data. 

- Which routing algorithm is most commonly used?
- How does EIGRP being propietary work if it needs to communicate with routers across the broader internet?
- What are the other routing algorithms that aren't mentioned in the room?

- The idea of network address translation really is another reminder of how common the tree logical structure is in computing. 
  - The entire protocol can be understood as a web of trunks and branches totally similar to how I see the trees outside my window right now.

- I liked the quiz site at the end of this room, I wouldn't mind stuff like that in other rooms for better material recall.
