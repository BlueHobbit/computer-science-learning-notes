# Summary 

# Notes
- What other networking tools is libpcap part of?

- What's the usage of porting libpcap over to Windows from Linux originally?

- Can you read pcap packet captures from tcpdump without needing to use the tcpdump -r flag or opening it in Wireshark instead?

- What would be a use case for limiting the number of packets captured? Taking a sample?

- Is there a reason to use the -n or -nn operator apart from stealth by not sending out the DNS requests since this might noticeably increase network traffic?
  - Yes sending out that many DNS requests also increases the delay in outputting packets that have been captured as it won't input till an attempt has been made to resolve the request. 

- What are 802.11s draft hash headers?

- What is promiscuous mode?

- Does capturing the packets prevent them from arriving at their destination?

- Is there more rooms or other challenges elsewhere I can use for learning more about Wireshark or Tcpdump or simply just getting more reps in with the tools?
